# Estimation Age Project
## Description

This application developed for testing purposes, So I focused on **Structure**. The application
developed by **Bloc** state management in MVVM. I also use **GetIt** for implementing **DI**.
For implementation of UI, I used both **Strategy** as well as **Factory** of **Design Patterns**
The application take a name from user and send it for www.agify.io api for get estimation age based on your name.
I also use  **Internal Cache** strategy for make app faster. 
In fetching data from api, you can see two implementation on with  **Async** and **Isolate**, but I prefered using **Async** here.
In test part you can see test
